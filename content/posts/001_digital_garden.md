Hello, world!

I am an engineer who graduated from Colombia, eager to travel the world, and I am currently working as an engineer in Portugal. It's been 11 months and I've learned a lot, so I thought it was time to start a blog-ish (digital gardenü™¥) to document everything I've learned!


This is my first ever digital garden aka dev blog! Check it out here üëâ[link](https://davidcardonadev.github.io/)

Except rather than a blog, I'd like to think of this as my digital garden where I [#learninpublic](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) üìù

I plan to populate my garden with info on:

- The stack I'm using: Python, Pandas, SQL, PowerBI, Tableu,MS Excel. 
- Misc stuff eg how to use DevTools, writing tests, notes, cheat sheets, my fav tech people.
- Projects I build.
- My journey as an Engineer and traveler.

Note that there is no set planting schedule, and the plants may be re-tended to.

I hope you enjoy visiting my garden.

And I look forward to being invited to yours one day.
