## SQL Queries Used

### 1. Data Retrieval

- **CovidDeaths**: Fetches data on COVID deaths by continent.
- **CovidVaccinations**: Retrieves data on COVID vaccinations.

### 2. Analysis

- **Likelihood of Death**: Calculates the likelihood of death if contracting COVID-19 in a specific country.
- **Percentage of Population Infected**: Shows the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 in a specific country.
- **Highest Infection Rate by Population**: Identifies countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.
- **Countries with Highest Death Count per Population**: Lists countries with the highest death count per population.
- **Death Count by Continent**: Displays the total death count by continent.
- **Rolling Vaccination Count**: Calculates the rolling count of people vaccinated against COVID-19.

### 3. Data Visualization

- **View Creation**: Creates a view named PercentPopulationVaccinated to store data for later visualizations.

## Key Findings

- The analysis revealed significant variations in COVID-19 death rates and vaccination rates across different countries and continents.
- Certain countries exhibited higher infection rates and death counts per population, indicating the severity of the pandemic's impact.
- Vaccination efforts varied widely, with some countries achieving higher vaccination rates compared to others.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on different regions worldwide. By analyzing death rates, infection rates, and vaccination efforts, it contributes to understanding the global response to the pandemic and informs decision-making processes.
