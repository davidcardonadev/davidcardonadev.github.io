## Dataset
The raw dataset includes the following columns:
- ID
- Marital Status
- Gender
- Income
- Children
- Education
- Occupation
- Home Owner
- Cars
- Commute Distance
- Region
- Age
- Purchased Bike

After cleaning the dataset, irrelevant columns were removed, and adjustments were made to enhance readability and analysis.

## Cleaning Process
1. **Column Selection:** Only relevant columns were retained for analysis, including Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Age Brackets, and Purchased Bike.

2. **Data Transformation:** Income values were standardized, removing special characters and converting them to numerical values. Age brackets were introduced to categorize customers into age groups.

## Dashboard Creation
The main analysis was conducted through pivot tables to visualize key insights. The dashboard includes the following pivot tables:
1. **Average Income by Gender and Bike Purchase Status:** This table provides insights into the average income of customers based on gender and whether they purchased a bike or not.
2. **Count of Purchased Bike by Commute Distance:** This table presents the count of bike purchases categorized by commute distance.
3. **Count of Purchased Bike by Age Brackets:** This table displays the count of bike purchases categorized by age brackets.

## Key Findings
1. **Income Analysis:** On average, male customers have a slightly higher income compared to female customers. Customers who purchased a bike tend to have slightly higher incomes overall.
2. **Commute Distance:** Most bike purchases occur for customers with commute distances between 0-1 miles and 5-10 miles.
3. **Age Distribution:** Middle-aged customers (between 40 and 60 years old) constitute the largest segment of bike purchasers.

## Conclusion
The dashboard provides valuable insights into bike sales trends based on customer demographics. Further analysis and exploration can be conducted to uncover additional patterns and optimize marketing strategies.
