The dataset contains information on customers, including demographic details such as gender, income, education, occupation, and commute distance, along with whether they purchased a bike or not.\nLink to the project 👉 Bike Sales Dashboard Project\nPicture of Jannis Lucas in Unsplash\nDataset The raw dataset includes the following columns:\nID Marital Status Gender Income Children Education Occupation Home Owner Cars Commute Distance Region Age Purchased Bike After cleaning the dataset, irrelevant columns were removed, and adjustments were made to enhance readability and analysis.\nCleaning Process Column Selection: Only relevant columns were retained for analysis, including Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Age Brackets, and Purchased Bike.\nData Transformation: Income values were standardized, removing special characters and converting them to numerical values. Age brackets were introduced to categorize customers into age groups.\nDashboard Creation The main analysis was conducted through pivot tables to visualize key insights. The dashboard includes the following pivot tables:\nAverage Income by Gender and Bike Purchase Status: This table provides insights into the average income of customers based on gender and whether they purchased a bike or not. Count of Purchased Bike by Commute Distance: This table presents the count of bike purchases categorized by commute distance. Count of Purchased Bike by Age Brackets: This table displays the count of bike purchases categorized by age brackets. Key Findings Income Analysis: On average, male customers have a slightly higher income compared to female customers. Customers who purchased a bike tend to have slightly higher incomes overall. Commute Distance: Most bike purchases occur for customers with commute distances between 0-1 miles and 5-10 miles. Age Distribution: Middle-aged customers (between 40 and 60 years old) constitute the largest segment of bike purchasers. Conclusion The dashboard provides valuable insights into bike sales trends based on customer demographics. Further analysis and exploration can be conducted to uncover additional patterns and optimize marketing strategies.\nDashboard bikes sales\nColophon\nthanks Alex for his tutorials and explanations (Alex The Analyst)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/005_dashboard_bikes_sales_in_excel/","summary":"This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data using Excel.

The data used in this project is sourced from the PortfolioProject database, containing information about COVID deaths and vaccinations across various locations and continents.\nLink to the project 👉 COVID Statistics Data Exploration Project\nPicture of KOBU Agency in Unsplash\nSQL Queries Used 1. Data Retrieval CovidDeaths: Fetches data on COVID deaths by continent. CovidVaccinations: Retrieves data on COVID vaccinations. 2. Analysis Likelihood of Death: Calculates the likelihood of death if contracting COVID-19 in a specific country. Percentage of Population Infected: Shows the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 in a specific country. Highest Infection Rate by Population: Identifies countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population. Countries with Highest Death Count per Population: Lists countries with the highest death count per population. Death Count by Continent: Displays the total death count by continent. Rolling Vaccination Count: Calculates the rolling count of people vaccinated against COVID-19. 3. Data Visualization View Creation: Creates a view named PercentPopulationVaccinated to store data for later visualizations. Key Findings The analysis revealed significant variations in COVID-19 death rates and vaccination rates across different countries and continents. Certain countries exhibited higher infection rates and death counts per population, indicating the severity of the pandemic\u0026rsquo;s impact. Vaccination efforts varied widely, with some countries achieving higher vaccination rates compared to others. Conclusion This project provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic\u0026rsquo;s impact on different regions worldwide. By analyzing death rates, infection rates, and vaccination efforts, it contributes to understanding the global response to the pandemic and informs decision-making processes.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/003_covid_statistics_data_exploration_project_in_sql/","summary":"This project aims to explore COVID-19 statistics using SQL queries.
