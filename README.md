# 🪴 Digital Garden

This is my first ever digital garden aka dev blog! Check it out here 👉[link](https://davidcardonadev.github.io/)

Except rather than a blog, I'd like to think of this as my digital garden where I [#learninpublic](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) 📝

I plan to populate my garden with plants on:

- The stack I'm using: Python, Pandas, SQL, PowerBI, Tableu,MS Excel. 
- Misc stuff eg how to use DevTools, writing tests, notes, cheat sheets, my fav tech people
- Projects I build
- My journey as a Engineer and traveler

Note that there is no set planting schedule, and the plants may be re-tended to.

I hope you enjoy visiting my garden.

And I look forward to being invited to yours one day.
